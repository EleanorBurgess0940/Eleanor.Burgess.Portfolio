# Eleanor.Burgess.Portfolio
    This file includes an index.html, portfolio.html, style.css, contact.html.
    
    This is my working portfolio. As you can see its quite empty because i have just now started to learn how to program or code. 
    
    I am a student at Upenn Bootcamp and i will be adding to this the projects/ homeworks that i complete. This is a great starter portfolio.
    
    As i will be able to use this for a while i have tried to make it as complete as possible. I will have to come back to this project to make the contact me page work as right now it doesnt do anything.

    I started this project by using Bootstrap grid system to layout the fundamentals of the website. The first thing i did was create my header. Which was not a great idea as making the list to the right of the page horizontal was my biggest hurdle. 

    I then moved on to create the footer. And with that had to create a theme for the site. The theme is where I kind of came away from bootstrap because i wasnt happy with how it was formatting some things. Hence my creation of the style.css

    I then created the content of each webpage one by one starting with the contact page. The form was from bootstrap. Next was the portfolio.html and then the index.html.
